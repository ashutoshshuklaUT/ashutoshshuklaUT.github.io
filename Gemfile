# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve
#

# This is the default theme for new Jekyll sites
gem "minima", "~> 2.5"

# To upgrade, run `bundle update github-pages`
gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins

# If you have any plugins, put them here!
group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem "jekyll-feed", "~> 0.12"
  gem "jekyll-seo-tag"
  gem "jekyll-sitemap"
  gem "jekyll-paginate"
