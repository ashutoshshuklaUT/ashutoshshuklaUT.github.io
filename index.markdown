<p><strong style="font-size: 1.5em;">Hello! I am Ashutosh Shukla</strong></p>

<p>I am an Applied Scientist with 7+ years of experience designing and deploying large-scale optimization and machine learning systems for operational networks. I lead algorithmic initiatives focused on automating planning and resource allocation across transportation and infrastructure systems.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size: 1.5em;">What I do</strong></p>

<p>I build optimization and machine learning systems for large-scale operational networks, with a focus on scheduling, routing, and resource allocation. At BNSF Railway, I serve as technical lead for network-wide assignment and scheduling systems. I am currently leading the development of an AI-based platform to automate railcar movement planning across BNSF’s yard network, a workflow managed by more than 100 operations managers.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size: 1.5em;">Technical Focus</strong></p>

<p><strong>Optimization:</strong> scheduling, assignments, routing, network modeling, and large-scale mixed-integer programming</p>

<p><strong>Machine Learning & AI:</strong> deep learning, reinforcement learning, time series modeling, and anomaly detection</p>

<p><strong>Infrastructure Systems:</strong> decision-support tools for planning under uncertainty</p>

<p>I work with tools such as PyTorch, Gurobi, Google OR-Tools, and AWS to build production-ready systems.</p>

<p><strong style="font-size: 1.5em;">Research Background</strong></p>

<p>I completed my PhD in Operations Research and Industrial Engineering at UT Austin, where I developed large-scale optimization frameworks for infrastructure planning under uncertainty. I designed stochastic and robust optimization models and implemented scalable solution methods, including parallelized decomposition algorithms, to solve high-dimensional network problems efficiently. My research has been published in peer-reviewed venues and received the Best Student Paper Award at the IISE Annual Conference. In addition, I also conducted research in reinforcement learning for sequential decision-making in networked systems, including inverse reinforcement learning for routing policy inference and multi-agent reinforcement learning for coordinated traffic optimization.</p>
