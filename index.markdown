        <p>Hello! I am Ashutosh Shukla, a Senior Operations Research Scientist in the Network Strategy Design and Innovation group at BNSF Railway. Prior to joining BNSF Railway, I received my PhD in Operations Research and Industrial Engineering from UT Austin.</p>

        <p>I am interested in developing mathematical models (and algorithmic approaches to solve them) that can aid in decision-making related to design and operations of complex networked infrastructures (think transportation networks, power networks, communication networks).</p>
